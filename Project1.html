        <h3>OFFICE BUILDING WITH DOUBLE TRANSPARENT FACADE</h3>
        <p>The object of the office building is located in Bratislava on the Mlynsk√© nivy street. The shape of the building was inspired by the letter L. This shape
          was chosen not only to enclose the area of the park, but also because this shape achieved a slight distance from the neighbouring building. The disturbance
          of the regular, simple shapes of the building was created by the receding 4th and 5th floors. This setback created a terraced space.
          Almost the entire envelope is glazed facade. There is double transparent facade on the west and south sides with a small part of the ventilated
          facade, the surface of which is made of anthracite aluminium Alucobond cladding.The shape divides the building into two tracts, which have separate
          cores. Softwares used for this project: Revit, Autocad, Twinmotion, Sketchup, Photoshop.</p>
